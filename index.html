## Introduction
    
APIs that facilitate access to verifiable claims about identity,
such as the proposed [Digital Credentials API](https://wicg.github.io/digital-credentials/),
are starting to be developed and deployed.
National digital identity systems are being legislated in a large number of jurisdictions.
The [Federated Identity Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2025/02/wg-fedid.html)
includes this API as a chartered deliverable.

These APIs represent a convenient way to access proof of legal identity,
backed by large-scale government projects in multiple jurisdictions.
This convenience leads to a range of implications for privacy,
as noted in a recent [objection](https://www.w3.org/2025/02/council-report-fedid-dig-cred.html)
to the formation of the Federated Identity Working Group.

A number of serious concerns were raised in this objection:

* Increased sharing of personal data
  and corresponding reduction of privacy
  due to reduced friction for sharing such data.
* Increased centralization of trust on the Web.
* Increased restriction of the ability
  to publish, view, and participate on the Web,
  and corresponding fragmentation of the Web as a whole.
* Reduction of user agency and perpetuation of existing societal power imbalances.

A [W3C Council](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#council) (which included members of the TAG)
found these concerns to be serious and valid.
Despite this, the working group was allowed to form,
though [the council report](https://www.w3.org/2025/02/council-report-fedid-dig-cred.html)
included a recommendation that the group seriously consider these factors as they develop the API.

The TAG believes that the addition of government issued digital credentials to the web
has great potential for harm.

The benefits of digital credentials
must be aligned with the [web user's needs](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies).
Following our established [principles for privacy](https://w3ctag.github.io/privacy-principles/),
this providing people the tools to understand and control
how their personal information is collected and used.
A browser--
or user agent--
plays an essential role
in mediating these types of requests
and enuring that people have agency.

The web should not become a platform that demands your government-issued identity documents,
your "papers",
in the course if its normal operation.
Use of such credentials should be exceptional,
only when required,
and always on a person's own terms.

The TAG therefore encourages contributors
to pay special attention to the societal impact of digital credentials.


## Uses for Identity Information ##

Before examining the harms,
it is important to understand why sites seek identity information
from visitors.
There are multiple reasons that a site might seek to ask for proof of legal identity.
Motivations include:

* Legal mandates,
  such as know-your-customer regulations common to financial services.
* Distinguishing between visits from real people and visits from bots,
  which might need to be handled specially.
* Obtaining some means of holding a person accountable
  for a range of abusive behavior.
* Avoiding impersonation,
  especially for social media accounts of prominent individuals or organizations.
* Personalization,
  such as being able to appear more friendly by greeting a person by their name.

This list is far from exhaustive.
Often, there are multiple reasons that a site seeks to identify a visitor.

Once someone has provided an identifier,
sites are technically able to use identifiers in any way they choose.
Technical privacy protections that might be implemented in a browser cannot help.
Legal protections might apply to misuse of identifying information,
but that depends on effective detection and enforcement.

Perhaps the most serious consequence of obtaining an identifier
is that sites are then able to trade information
across any site where a person has provided that same identifier.
This enables tracking,
a form of surveillance,
where people their activities across multiple contexts,
both on- and off-line,
gathered into profiles.
These profiles are then used for many purposes
including advertising, credit ratings, and market analysis.



## Tracking with Identity ##

For all its benefits,
one of the most shameful aspects of the web is how it has allowed sites to surveil people.
Sites take what they learn about the people that visit them
and treat that information as a commodity to be sold or exchanged.

The TAG has long regarded [unsanctioned tracking as unacceptable](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/unsanctioned-tracking/)
and has advocated for technical measures that curtail these practices.
Notably, [the TAG unequivocally condemned cross-site cookies and called for browsers to disable them](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/web-without-3p-cookies/).
Positive trends from browsers in recent years include a range of other technical measures,
including reductions in fingerprinting, state partitioning, and [navigation tracking mitigations](https://privacycg.github.io/nav-tracking-mitigations/).

These technical measures are consistent with the TAG's [documented principles for privacy](https://w3ctag.github.io/privacy-principles/).
These principles articulate why privacy is essential to maintaining personal autonomy.
The same high-level principles are shared
by the many jurisdictions that have implemented data protection legislation.
The goal of data protection is to protect a person's rights over how data about them is used.

In part due to these protections,
tracking practices are moving away from largely hidden mechanisms--
like cookies--
to human interactions based on consent.
That is, sites ask people to identify themselves.
Once identifying information is provided,
sites might then assume that they have consent to use that information for a range of purposes.

Identity information might be provided as an email address or phone number.
However, more sites also seek to obtain legal names or other identifying information.
Unauthenticated systems might offer people the ability to choose how they wish to be identified.
For instance, email services that provide temporary or site-specific aliases
offer a way to create wholly-new or site-specific identities on demand.
The same flexibility is not an option when providing a legal identity.

Tracking with identity allows online activities
to be linked to offline activity.
The result can be a comprehensive record of everything a person does:
places they go,
what sites they visit,
what they say,
who they are friends with,
and more.


## Overuse of Identity ##

A streamlined process for providing verifiable identity
reduces the cost of requesting and providing that information.
In turn, this might make sites that would otherwise not ask for information
choose to take advantage of reduced friction to make a request.


### Authorizing Sites ###

Something about EU/EIDAS


### Case Study: Aadhaar ###

That digital credentials might be used to track people is not a fancy of science fiction,
it is the lived experience of a very large number of people.

In India,
the Aadhaar national identity scheme was introduced as a way to enable access to government services,
like health, welfare, and food assistance.
Though the legislation
originally included the option for Aadhaar to be used by non-government actors,
that provision
(Section 57)
was ruled [unconstitutional](https://www.thehindu.com/news/resources/article25048939.ece/binary/AadhaarVerdict.pdf)
by the Supreme Court in 2018.

In 2025,
the Indian government has enabled wide use of Aadhar for any entitiy,
expanding the set of recognized reasons
to include "[promoting ease of living for residents](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2098223)".
As a result,
the roughly 1 billion Indian participants in the Aadhaar program
are potentially subject to surveillance through the use of their unique 12 digit identifier,
which links fingerprints and iris scans to name and other personal details.

Despite Aadhar use being optional in law,
even prior to this change,
its use was widespread in employment and other non-government interactions.


## Centralization of Trust ##

TODO *exclusion... discouraging sites from working with the authorities they recognize... could lead to fragmentation along geographical lines ... one web principle ... biggest players...*

## Exclusion ##

Online services that have [real-name policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-name_system) are justifiably controversial.
These systems have historically resulted in excluding certain people,
often due to people having names that systems do not recognize.

A system that relies on a central authority is unlikely to replicate the same failures.
New risks of exclusion arise:

* Sites that only recognize credentials from local authorities
  could unjustly exclude people from out of town,
  either temporarily or permanently.
* People might temporarily lose access to credentials
  because of a lost personal device
  or temporary disability.
* People might be completely unable to obtain or use credentials.
* Systems that include the ability to revoke credentials
  can be abused by attackers
  to forcibly exclude people.

In some cases,
such as Aadhaar,
the law recognizes the risk that people might not be able to produce evidence
that they hold a credential.
Better laws recognize this risk
and require that people not be refused service as a result.

Even if laws only permit the use of digital credentials as a convenience,
there is a risk that no alternative means of access to services are provided.
This leads to exclusion.

It should not be possible to refuse service to a person
based on their refusal or inability to make use of digital credentials.
This is aligned with such principles
as [not revealing when assistive technologies are in use](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#do-not-expose-use-of-assistive-tech)
or [non-retaliation](https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/#non-retaliation).

Any credential system therefore needs to carefully consider
what might happen if someone is unable to authenticate or they refuse to.
This might include things like non-trivial induced failure rates,
which could ensure that sites do not come to assume
that all users are equally able to produce a credential.

## Use Cases and Technical Options ##

A better understanding of why sites seek to obtain and use identity is necessary.
While the universality of a generic solution is appealing,
each use case could depend on providing different sorts of information.

[... need to have more on use cases in here ...]

Each use case might require a different type of solution.
Different solutions can have dramatically different privacy characteristics.

For example,
a [data minimization](https://w3ctag.github.io/privacy-principles/#data-minimization) approach might favor the use of selective disclosure,
so that people can choose what to disclose,
either accepting the [linkability risks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-17#name-unlinkability)
or regarding those as critical to ensuring that bad actors can be traced if necessary.

In contrast, a system that seeks to authorize based on certain traits--
such as a system to authorize access to online gambling,
something that might be restricted by age or past history of susceptibility--
might be best suited to a zero-knowledge system
that provides strong unlinkability.

## Identity For Whom ##

Despite considerable investment
in both technical and legal privacy protections,
sites gather more information about people than they have previously.
The use of government-issued identity on the web
could make that situation worse
if sites are able to insist that people present proof of identity.

Normalizing the practice of providing identity credentials to websites
risks serious harm.
Providing any form of external identity information needs to be an exceptional process.

For example, it is entirely inappropriate to use government-issued credentials
as a login credential,
even if credentials are used during account creation.

European [identity legislation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation)
describes a system that has some potential to counteract
the worst kinds of abuses that come from overuse of identity credentials.
Entities that request EU digital identity
will need to show that they are authorized.
That authorization will be linked a public record
that includes what information each entity can request
and how they intend to use it.
Implemented correctly,
such a system could bring transparency and accountability.

These systems carry risks,
as demonstrated by experience with Aadhaar.
A system that was designed for use by government--
where non-governmental use was deemed an unconstitutional imposition on privacy--
is now open to use by private actors.
Even before that,
[Aadhaar was widely used to disempower Indian citizens](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345088314_Digital_identity_datafication_and_social_justice_understanding_Aadhaar_use_among_informal_workers_in_south_India).
These kinds of harms directly counteract some of the benefits that the system provides,
in terms of improved access to government services, banking, healthcare and other critical services.
